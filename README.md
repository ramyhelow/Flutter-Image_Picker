# Flutter Image Picker (Proof of Concept)

A proof of concept Flutter application demonstrating camera integration and image display capabilities. This project serves as a simple demonstration of how to implement basic camera functionality in a Flutter application.

## Overview

This PoC demonstrates:
- Basic camera integration using the `image_picker` package
- Simple image capture and display functionality
- Basic state management for image handling
- Loading screen implementation

## Features

- Camera integration for taking pictures
- Real-time image preview
- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Loading screen for better user experience

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (latest version recommended)
- Android Studio / Xcode for running on emulators
- A physical device for testing camera functionality

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Flutter-Image_Picker.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Flutter-Image_Picker
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

4. Run the app:
```bash
flutter run
```

## Usage

1. Launch the app
2. Wait for the loading screen to complete
3. Tap the camera icon (floating action button) to take a picture
4. The captured image will be displayed on the screen

## Dependencies

- `image_picker`: For accessing the device's camera
- `flutter`: The core Flutter framework

## Future Improvements

This PoC could be extended with:
- Image editing capabilities
- Multiple image selection
- Image storage and management
- Gallery view
- Image sharing functionality
- Filters and effects

## Note

This is a proof of concept project and is not intended for production use. It serves as a starting point for implementing camera functionality in Flutter applications.
